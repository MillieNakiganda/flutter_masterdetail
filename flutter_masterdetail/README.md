# flutter_masterdetail

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This app simply holds a list of numbers and displays a number prominently when tapped on. We have a master list of numbers and a detail view that displays a number when clicked. Just like the emails in the gmail app.

if we had the same exact layout in tablets, it would be a waste of space because the table space is large enough to hold those 2 screens.

So for the app to be responsive, we display the master list and the detail page on the same screen for the screens with a width larger than 600dps.
